## Adding a new application (using CLI)

The following instructions use a command line utility ([anthos-platform-cli](cli/) to onboard an application into the system.

1. Download the `anthos-platform-cli` binary to your machine. Take note of getting the binary for the correct operating system.

    [Mac OS](https://storage.googleapis.com/solutions-public-assets/anthos-platform-cli/v0.4.0/anthos-platform-cli-v0.4.0-darwin-amd64)

    [Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/solutions-public-assets/anthos-platform-cli/v0.4.0/anthos-platform-cli-v0.4.0-linux-amd64)

    [Windows](https://storage.googleapis.com/solutions-public-assets/anthos-platform-cli/v0.4.0/anthos-platform-cli-v0.4.0-windows-amd64)

1. After downloading the binary, rename it and make it executable:

  ```shell
  mv anthos-platform-cli-* anthos-platform-cli
  chmod +x anthos-platform-cli
  ```

1. Run the app creation command, providing your GitLab root user password as the --gitlab-token parameter and providing an application name. Parameters that you need to alter are in red below:

  ```shell
  ./anthos-platform-cli add app --name my-app-name --gitlab-hostname gitlab.your.domain.com --gitlab-token GITLAB_ROOT_PASSWORD --template-name golang-template
  ```

## Adding a new feature/version of the application

The following steps are performed by a **developer**, and can be performed locally or in Cloud Shell.

### Testing the change locally with Skaffold

1. [Install skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)
1. [Install kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#quickly-curl-the-latest)
1. Clone your app repository

`git clone git@gitlab.platform.1.vic.dev:go-app-1/go-test-app-1.git
cd go-test-app-1`

1. Get credentials for the shared dev cluster

  ```shell
  gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region us-central1 dev
  ```

1. Set your default repository for skaffold to use. This repo needs to be accessible from the dev cluster.

  ```shell
  /vic-gke-on-prem-0/viglesias
  ```

1. Run Skaffold in developer mode so that it rebuilds your application as it changes:

  ```shell
  skaffold dev --port-forward
  ```

1. Change code and look at the logs in your console to ensure the expected results. If you are running skaffold on your local machine, point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`, if in Cloud Shell hit the "Web Preview" button.

1. Commit code, push to branch and create a merge request.

1. After CI passes, merge the MR.

### Setting up your change for production

1. After your MR into your app succeeds, the CI pipeline will perform a few actions:  unit-test, build, kustomize, push-manifests.

1. The last step, push-manifests actually pushes a file into the app-env repo's staging branch, go check it out and you'll see the output:

   ```console
   remote: To create a merge request for staging, visit:
   remote:   https://gitlab.smcghee.dev/go-team-go/go-app-env/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=staging
   ```

1. You can now find your app running in the staging cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectx staging
   kubectl get po -n go-test-app-1
   kubectl get svc -n go-test-app-1
   ```

1. You can port-forward the staging build as well:

   ```shell
   kubectl port-forward svc/go-test-app-1-app -n go-test-app-1 8080:8080
   ```

1. At this point your feature is ready to be deployed to production.  An Operator will perform this.

## Promoting changes from Staging to Production

The following steps are performed by an **Operator**.

1. Once you are ready to deploy whatever is in Staging to the Production clusters (you may pull in many changes from various developers), you will do so by creating a Merge Request in the ${APP}-env **staging** branch onto **master**.
1. In Gitlab UI, navigate to the ${APP}-env repo (not the ${APP} repo).
![env repo branch](../images/env-repo-branch.png)

1. Create a new MR (ie [https://GITLAB_HOSTNAME/go-team-go/go-app-env/merge_requests](https://gitlab.smcghee.dev/go-team-go/go-app-env/merge_requests))

1. Get a peer to approve this MR (or approve it yourself if you are feeling lucky)

1. Click "Merge".

1. The CICD in GitLab will kick off your deployment to all clusters, in order:
![Production pipeline](../images/prod-deployment-pipeline-ui.png)

1. You are live in all production clusters!

If you want to add another cluster (like asia-east1 in the above screenshots), read on!

## Adding a cluster to the platform

1. Create a new GKE cluster:

   ```shell
   gcloud compute regions list  # pick anywhere!`
   ```

   ```shell
   # set to the domain used during install
   export DOMAIN="ap-123412.cloud-tutorial.dev"
   export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
   export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
   gcloud beta container clusters create ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME} \
   --region=${NEW_REGION} \
   --release-channel=stable
   ```

1. You should now be in the context of your new cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl config current-context
   ```

   This should return a line like:
   `gke_smcghee-anthos-platform-demo-0_**asia-east1**_anthos-platform-**prod-asia-east1`**

1. Clone your ACM repo, as hosted in your GitLab instance. You will use this repo in later steps.

   ```shell
   git clone git@gitlab.${DOMAIN}:platform-admins/anthos-config-management.git
   ```

1. Clone the `shared-ci-cd` and any `${APP}` and `${APP}-env` repos on your local machine, for any apps you want deployed in this new cluster.

   ```shell
   export APP_NAME=go-app
   git clone git@gitlab.${DOMAIN}:platform-admins/shared-ci-cd.git
   git clone git@gitlab.${DOMAIN}:${APP_NAME}/${APP_NAME}.git
   git clone git@gitlab.${DOMAIN}:${APP_NAME}/${APP_NAME}-env.git
   ```

1. Setup ACM on the new cluster by applying the config management operator manifest into your newly created cluster:

   ```shell
   gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/config-management-operator.yaml config-management-operator.yaml
   kubectl apply -f config-management-operator.yaml
   ```

1. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/downloads) the `nomos` CLI locally:

   MacOS - gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/darwin_amd64/nomos nomos
   Linux - gsutil cp gs://config-management-release/released/latest/linux_amd64/nomos nomos

1. Create an SSH keypair that nomos can use to authenticate with your ACM Git repository.`

   ```shell
   export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
   export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 \
      -C "**$SHORT_CLUSTERNAME**" \
      -N '' \
      -f **$SHORT_CLUSTERNAME
   ```

1. Go to the ACM Git repository in GitLab. https://GITLAB_HOSTNAME/platform-admins/anthos-config-management

1. Click on "Settings->Repository"

    ![setttings->repository](../images/settings-repository.png)

1. In the main pane, click on the "Expand" button in the "Deploy Keys" heading.  You should already see keys for existing production and staging clusters.  
    ![deploy keys](../images/deploy-keys.png)

1. Use the title "Production $NEW_REGION deploy key" and Paste in the public key (`prod-$NEWREGION.pub`) from the SSH key pair you just created and then click the green "Add key" button.
   Do not check the "write access allowed" checkbox, it only needs read access.
   The key should start with "ssh-rsa" â€¦ it should NOT start with "--- BEGIN PRIVATE KEY ---" .. that's the wrong file!

1. Create a secret in your cluster that contains the private key of the SSH key pair.

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
  kubectl create secret generic git-creds --namespace=config-management-system --from-file=ssh=./$SHORT_CLUSTERNAME
  ```

1. Create a Anthos Config Management configuration for your cluster:

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
  cat > config-management.yaml <<EOF
  apiVersion: configmanagement.gke.io/v1
  kind: ConfigManagement
  metadata:
    name: config-management
  spec:
    # clusterName is required and must be unique among all managed clusters
    clusterName: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
    git:
      syncRepo: git@gitlab.${DOMAIN}:platform-admins/anthos-config-management.git
      syncBranch: master
      secretType: ssh
  EOF
  ```

1. Apply the configuration to your cluster

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f config-management.yaml
  ```

1. Check the status of the installation with the following command. Your cluster should now be synced.

    ```shell
    chmod +x ./nomos
    ./nomos status --contexts $(kubectl config current-context)
    ```

    You should see some output like:

    ```console
    Connecting to clusters...
    Current   Context                                              Status           Last Synced Token   Sync Branch
    -------   -------                                              ------           -----------------   -----------
    *         -demo-0_asia-east1_anthos-platform-prod-asia-east1   SYNCED           18f31861            master
              prod-central                                         SYNCED           18f31861            master
              prod-east                                            SYNCED           18f31861            master
              staging                                              SYNCED           18f31861            master
    ```

1. Now we need to add our new cluster to be usable in ACM:

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
  cd anthos-config-management
  cat > clusterrgistry/${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}.yaml <<EOF
  kind: Cluster
  apiVersion: clusterregistry.k8s.io/v1alpha1
  metadata:
    name: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
    labels:
      environment: prod
      clusterName: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  EOF

  cat > selector-${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}.yaml <<EOF
  kind: ClusterSelector
  apiVersion: configmanagement.gke.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        clusterName: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  EOF
  ```

1. For the ACM unit tests to be useful in our new cluster, first add a cluster entry for gitlab runner configmaps and add the configuration of the Gitlab runner for running ACM tests.`

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
  cat >> namespaces/acm-tests/gitlab-runner-configmap-per-cluster.yaml <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: gitlab-runner-config-acm
    annotations:
      configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  data:
    CI_SERVER_URL: https://gitlab.${DOMAIN}
    KUBERNETES_IMAGE: ubuntu:16.04
    KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE: acm-tests
    REGISTER_LOCKED: "true"
    RUNNER_EXECUTOR: kubernetes
    RUNNER_REQUEST_CONCURRENCY: "1"
    RUNNER_TAG_LIST: app:acm-tests, cluster:${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  EOF
  ```

1. Commit the change and push it to your ACM repo

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export SHORT_CLUSTERNAME="prod-${NEW_REGION}"
  git add namespaces/acm-tests/gitlab-runner-configmap-per-cluster.yaml
  git commit -m "add new cluster: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}"
  git push origin master
  ```

1. Now, for each app that needs to run in this new cluster, add a file:

  ```shell
  export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
  export APPNAME="go-app"

  cd namespaces/managed-apps/$APPNAME/`
  cat >> gitlab-runner-configmap-prod-${NEWREGION}.yaml <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: gitlab-runner-config
    annotations:
      configmanagement.gke.io/cluster-selector: ${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
  data:
    CI_SERVER_URL: "https://gitlab.${DOMAIN}/"
    CLONE_URL: ""
    RUNNER_REQUEST_CONCURRENCY: "1"
    RUNNER_EXECUTOR: "kubernetes"
    REGISTER_LOCKED: "true"
    RUNNER_TAG_LIST: "app:go-test-app-1, cluster:${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}"
    KUBERNETES_IMAGE: "ubuntu:16.04"
    KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE: "go-test-app-1"
    KUBERNETES_PULL_POLICY: "always"
  EOF
  ```

1. For each repo, push changes:

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "adding $NEWREGION"
   git push origin master
   ```

1. Now make similar changes in your `${APPNAME}-env` repo. This time we're going to make our changes in the `staging` branch, which already was created when we made our app above.

      ```shell
      export APPNAME="go-app"
      cd ${APPNAME}-env
      git checkout staging
      git pull
      cat >> .gitlab-ci.yml <<EOF
      deploy-prod-asia-east1:
        tags:
        - cluster:${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}, app:go-test-app-1
      stages:
      - deploy-${SHORT_CLUSTERNAME}
      EOF
      ```

1. Commit the changes:

      ```shell
      git add .gitlab-ci.
      git commit -m "adding new cluster to CD"
      git push
      ```

1. Now in the Gitlab web UI, navigate to the link shown in the output of your last git command, which should look like:

      ```console
      remote: To create a merge request for staging, visit:
      remote:   https://GITLAB_HOSTNAME/go-app/go-app-env/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=staging`
      ```

1. Choose "Submit merge request".

1. Click "Merge" (don't choose to delete the source branch).

   Note that for $app-env, you will have to push to staging branch first, then perform an MR.

1. Add the new cluster to the Shared CI/CD configuration repo:

      ```shell
      cd platform-admins/shared-ci-cd
      export NEW_REGION="asia-east1"
      cat >> cd/gke-deploy.yaml <<EOF
      deploy-prod-${NEWREGION}:
        # Only deploy when running on master in $APP-env
        only:
          refs:
            - master
        stage: deploy-prod-${NEWREGION}
        image: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gke-deploy:stable
        tags:
        - cluster:prod-${NEWREGION}
        script:
        - |
        - /gke-deploy run --filename kustomize-prod.yaml
      EOF
      ```

1. Now your deploys will go to your new region too!

## Deleting an application

The following steps are performed by an operator.

1. In Cloud Shell, clone the `anthos-config-management` repo.

  ```shell
  git clone git@gitlab.ap-3.vic.dev:platform-admins/anthos-config-management.git
  ```

1. Create a new branch in the local repo for deleting the app.

  ```shell
  cd anthos-config-management
  git checkout -b delete-go-app-1
  ```

1. Delete the app folder under the `namespaces/managed-apps` folder.

  ```shell
  rm -rf namespaces/managed-apps/go-app-1
  ```

1. Commit and push the changes back to the repo in the new branch.

  ```shell
  git add .
  git commit -am "deleted app go-app-1"
  git push -u origin delete-go-app-1
  ```

1. Your changes created in a branch need to be merged into the master branch for Anthos Config Management operator to delete the resources and policies on the GKE clusters.  Create a Merge Request.  The Merge Request is then reviewed and merged into the master branch by a peer Operator.

1. Click on the **Create Merge Request** button.

1. Add a suitable title for the Merge request.

1. Click **Submit merge request** at the bottom.

1. Check **Delete source branch** and click **Merge**.

1. Once merged into the master branch, the application and its associated resources i.e. namespace, any deployments and the Gitlab CI runners are deleted by the ACM operator.

1. Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and confirm resources are deleted in the GKE clusters by going to the **Kubernetes engine > workloads** page and filtering by **Namespace: go-test-app-1**.

1. Delete the Group.  Navigate to the `go-app-demo-1` group in the Gitlab UI.  Click on **Settings > General** from the lefthand navbar and the expand the **Advanced** section at the bottom.
1. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Remove group**. Note that deleting the Group also deletes any projects in the group.

1. Enter the Group name again when prompted and click **Confirm**.
Note: This is an irreversible process.  You cannot recover any removed Groups/Projects.  Proceed with caution!
